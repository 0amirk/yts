          <p>
            Before entering the sacred state of IHRAM, which is necessary before
            beginning your UMRAH, it is mandatory to do the following:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove unwanted hair, clip nails, trim
              moustache etc
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make Ghusl (if possible) or make Wudhu</li>
            <li>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wear Ihram prior to arriving at the Meeqat
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pray 2 raka&#39;at (optional)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <br />
            After doing all of the above, you should make an intention for
            performing Umrah by reciting the following words:
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Allah humma inni ureedul amrata fa yas-sir haa lee wa
            taqabbal haa minni &quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;O Allah, I intend to perform Umrah; make it easy for me and
            accept from me&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            For entering the state of Ihram, recite the Talbiyah:-
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeyka laka
            labbayk, innal-hamda wan-ni&#39;mata laka wal-mulk, laa shareeyka
            lak &quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Here I am, O Allaah, here I am. Here I am, you have no
            partner, here I am.&rdquo;
            <br />
            &ldquo;Verily all praise and blessings, and all sovereignty are
            Yours. You have no partner.&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            Then you will proceed to Makkah and head to al-Masjid al-Haram,
            while continuously repeating the Talbiyah.

            <strong>Being in Debt while performing Hajj and Umrah</strong>
            <br />
            There are doubts in the minds of people wanting to perform the Hajj
            and Umrah, about whether or not one should perform the pilgrimage
            while being in debt. For answering this question, it is important to
            understand that there are two types of debts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>What are Scheduled Debts?</strong>
            <br />
            Scheduled debts are those type of debts that are required to be paid
            back over a fixed period of time in installments. These debts
            typically include a house, car or appliance mortgage, and those
            debts that are to be repaid in one installment on a fixed date.
            Settling scheduled debts before performing Hajj or Umrah is not
            mandatory and you can perform both pilgrimages even if you are
            repaying, or have to repay scheduled debts.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>What are Non-scheduled Debts</strong>
            <br />
            Non-scheduled debts are those type of debts where there is no
            defined repayment schedule. These debts typically include loans
            taken from family members, friends and professional individual
            lenders.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Before embarking for Hajj or Umrah, it is mandatory that you either
            settle the entire non-scheduled debt or take permission from the
            person you have taken the loan. Only after your lender has given you
            permission to perform Hajj or Umrah, you should proceed towards
            performing the pilgrimage.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Allah accepts only what is pure</strong>
            <br />
            You should ensure that you pay for the sacred pilgrimage only from
            &ldquo;halal&rdquo; income or that income which is lawful in the
            eyes of Islam. You must understand that Allah is pure and will
            accept only what is pure. It is mandatory that you perform Hajj or
            Umrah by spending money that has been earned only through
            &ldquo;halal&rdquo; means.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prophet Muhammad&nbsp; mentioned the case of a man who, having
            journeyed far, is dishevelled and dusty, and who spreads out his
            hands to the sky saying &ldquo;O Lord! O Lord!&rdquo; while his food
            is haram (unlawful), his drink is haram, his clothing is
            haram,&nbsp;
            <br />
            and he has been nourished with haram, so how can [his supplication]
            be answered?&quot;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Taking belongings for Umrah &amp; Hajj</strong>
            <br />
            When the faithful are about to embark on the Hajj or Umrah
            pilgrimage, the first thing that comes to their mind concerns the
            number of items they should take along with them on the pilgrimage.
          </p>

          <p>
            While there is no doubt that paying special attention to packing for
            the pilgrimage is important, you should also note that Allah Himself
            says in the Qur&rsquo;an: &ldquo;And take provision for the
            journey&rdquo;. This means that along with physical preparation,
            mental and spiritual preparation is also important.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Seek forgiveness before your pilgrimage </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            When there are some days left for your departure to the holy land
            for perform the sacred pilgrimage, you should meet your relatives
            and friends and seek their forgiveness.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you have difference with someone or are not on talking terms with
            them, you should meet them and resolve your differences, rather than
            performing the pilgrimage while keeping the grudge in your heart and
            mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            Keep in mind that the purpose of making this journey is to seek
            acceptance of our deeds and our shortcomings from Allah.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is important tat you are kind and compassionate towards your
            family, relatives and friends, ask them for forgiveness for any of
            your wrongdoings and also forgive them for any of their wrongdoings.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Preparing your body is important</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Be prepared for exertion and tiredness during your pilgrimage, as it
            will surely take a physical toll on your body. During the entire
            pilgrimage, you will walk much more than you have walked earlier.
          </p>

          <p>
            To give you an example, the distance of the walking ritual between
            Safa and Marwa for commemorating the painful journey undertaken by
            Lady Hajar to find water for her son, is more than 3 km.
          </p>

          <p>
            We suggest you prepare for this ritual by walking briskly daily for
            at least 5 miles in one session. This will ensure that when you have
            to walk during Hajj and Umrah, your body will not feel too tired,
            and you will be able to comfortably perform the rituals.
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>Preparing the mind </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            For truly appreciating all the sacred rituals of Hajj and Umrah, it
            is important to keep two things in mind, Dhikr (remembrance) and
            Taslim (complete submission to Allah).
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>DHIKR</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            During the entire pilgrimage, you should keep Allah in our mind and
            keep reminding yourself of the objective of your holy journey. You
            should do this by regularly repeating the Talbiyah &ldquo;Here I
            come to Allah to perform Umrah or Hajj.&rdquo;
          </p>

          <p>
            <br />
            <strong>TASLIM</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Without wondering about the purpose of each ritual of Hajj and
            Umrah, you should completely and unconditionally surrender to the
            will of Allah, taking inspiration of the saying of Prophet Muhammad
            ï·º &ldquo;Take from me your rituals&rdquo;. You should fully believe
            in the fact that all of Islam&rsquo;s rituals come from Allah and
            his Messenger and are filled with meaning. All we have to do is
            simply surrender to the will and order of Allah, and humbly do what
            He has ordained for us.
